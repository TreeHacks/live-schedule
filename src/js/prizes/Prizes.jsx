We’re calling on TreeHacks teams to envision the best technology-enabled patient safety solution that has the potential to avert patient harm and save lives and will be awarding $2,000 to the top team. Your hack must align with one of the following five leading patient safety challenges facing health care across the continuum of care: Medication errors, procedural/surgical errors, errors during routine patient care (e.g. pressure ulcers, blood clots, falls), infections and diagnostic safety. We encourage teams to consider autonomous tech-enabled patient safety solutions – those that are able to take action with little or no human supervision – as well.
